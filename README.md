# Chaos
Boilerplate to build static websites: Pug, Jake, Livereload and an HTTP server.

> In Greek mythology, Chaos (Greek: Χάος) was the first thing to exist. The personification of nothingness from which all of existence sprang. Depicted as a void. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_(mythology))


## How to use

1. Clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/jameskolce/chaos.git`.
2. Edit all the necessary things, specially the `package.json` file with your project data.
3. Add your code.


## Available NPM commands

- `start`: Will execute the default Jake task. Builds the source files and starts a watcher for all of those files. Then starts livereload to reload changes in the browser, and finally, starts an HTTP server in `localhost:8080` to see the website.

- `build`: Will build the source files. Won’t start any watcher or server.
